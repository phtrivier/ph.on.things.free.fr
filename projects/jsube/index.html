   <h2><a name="concept">What the hell is that ?</a></h2>
   <p>JsUbe is Ube in the browser.</p>
   
   <p>This is an attempt to port <a href="../../projects/ube/index.html">Ube</a> in the browser, using the canvas tag and other
     HTML5-ish features. </p>

   <p>It will only work in <emph>modern</emph> browser, like Firefox (version 3.6 or later) or Chrome (I haven't tested in on Safari or Opera, but it should be
     decent.) It will probably <emph>not<emph> work on any version of Internet Explorer, sorry.

   <p>The game is still played with the mouse. It is pretty forgiving : you have unlimited undo / redo, and the path you can take
     is displayed as soon as you move the mouse over a place in the maze.</p>

   <p>It's free software available under the MIT License.</p>

   <h2><a name="screenshots">Hum...kay, what does it look like?</a></h2>

   <h3>The game</h3>

   <p>It looks like this : </p>

   <img src="pics/jsube.png" alt="Screenshot from jsube main game screen"/>

   <p>In this screen, the little blue ball (with cute eyes) is you. The exit is the other "blue" cell.</p>
   <p>You have two moves available. The "green" move lets you advance one
     cell at a time. The "yellow" moves lets you jump two cells at a
     time. Moves are represented by buttons at the bottom of the screen.</p>

   <p>There are two colored cells (one in green, one in yellow). If you reach those cells, you get one
     new available move.</p>
   
   <p>I know, this doesn't look great, but I am no artist :( ...</p>

   <h2><a name="complaints">This doesn't work !!!!!</a></h2>
   <p>If you're using the right browser (FF 3.6 or more, Chrome), then okay, you can shout at phtrivier AT yahoo DOT fr, I might even be able to help !</p>

   <h2>This looks like crap !!!!</h2>
   <p>I'am glad you mentionned it. I know. Thanks for nicely offering
   to help ;) </p>

   <h2>Dude, the name sucks !</h2>

   <p>I know. What's in a name anyway ? I guess sometimes you just
     type a couple of letter on your keyboard, the acronym is not
     taken, and you decide it might as well do for a name.</p>

   <h2>Where is the documentation ???</h2>

   <p>There is none for the moment, there will definitely be a 'tutorial' sometimes.</p>
