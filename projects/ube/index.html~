   <h1>Boots Puzzle</h1>

   <h2>What the hell is that ?</h2>
   <p>Boots puzzle is a little game for GNU/Linux.</p>
   <p>You're a playing a vaguely lab-rat-like guy who must go from the
     entry of a room (in blue) to the exit of a room (in green).</p>
   <p>At startup you walk with your bare feet, but you can pick
     'boots' that will let you move several cells at a time, walk on
     water, move like a Knight in chess, etc...</p>
   <p>The game is written in Ruby, with a DSL to create new rooms, new
     kind of boots, and script everything.</p>
   <p>Oh, did I mentionned it's free software released under GPL ?</p>

   <hr/>

   <h2>Hum...kay, what does it look like?</h2>

   <h3>The game</h3>

   <p>It looks like sh...omething that can be really improved at the
     moment, but something like this :</p>

   <img src="pics/screenshot_v0.3.2.png" alt="Boots Puzzle,v0.3.2"/>

   <p>In this screen, you have your player, you're using 'double
     boots' so you can jump two cells at a time, and arrows show you
     where you can go.</p>

   <h3>The editor</h3>
   <p>There is a <a href="http://shoooes.net">Shoes</a> app to create the puzzles, and it looks even uglier than the game itself : </p>

   <img width="800" src="pics/screenshot_puzzle_editor.png" alt="Puzzle editor"/>

   <p>Still, making GUIs with Shoes is pretty fun, you should try it if you're a rubyist or something</p>

   <hr/>

   <h2>Okay, let me try it !</h2>

   <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
   <p>I've only tested this on MY machine, a i486 with Ubuntu Hardy
   Heron. So don't expect miracles if you're too far from this kind of configuration.</p>

   <h3>Disclaimer, the return</h3>
   <p>This is really a work-in-beginning-of-sort-of-progress, so there
     is still a lot that might break, look stupid, etc...
     <br/>
     <q>Don't shoot the coder, he's doing his best.</q>
   </p>

   <h3>Install and play (for lucky debian users)</h3>

   <ul>
     <li>Edit /etc/apt/sources.list and add the following line :
       <p class="command">
       deb http://ph.on.things.free.fr/projects/boots-puzzle/apt binary/
       </b>
       </p>
     </li>
     <li>Politely ask debian to install the things :
       <p class="command">sudo apt-get install boots-puzzle</p>
     </li>
     <li>Run the game :
       <p class="command">boots-puzzle --adventure=demo</p>
     </li>
     <li>Ask for help:
       <p class="command">boots-puzzle -v</p>
     </li>
   </ul>

   <h3>From sources</h3>

   <h4>Get sources</h4>
   <ul>
     <li>Latest released version
     : <a href="releases/boots-puzzle-0.3.9.tar.gz">0.3.9</a> (Sept 25, 2009)</li>
     <li>Browse releases : <a href="releases">Releases</a></li>
     <li>From Github :
     git://github.com/phtrivier/boots-puzzle.git</li>
   </ul>

   <h4>Install</h4>
   <p>Then read INSTALL for more details, but basically you will need
   to install ruby and a couple of ruby gems... I'm working on
   improving the distribution, don't worry...</p>

   <h4>Play!</h4>
   <p>There are two adventures to play in releases ; one is 'foobar',
   and it really sucks. The other one is called 'demo', and it
   demonstrates more stuff. So go for this :</p>
   <b>rake demo</b>

   <p>But if you feel adventurous ..</p>

   <b>rake play adventure=foobar</b>

   <p>In any case, you should give this a try : </p>

   <b>rake help</b>

   <h2>This doesn't work !!!!!</h2>
   <p>Okay, you can shout at phtrivier AT yahoo DOT fr, I might even be able to help !</p>

   <hr/>

   <h2>This looks like crap !!!!</h2>
   <p>I'am glad you mentionned it. I know. Thanks for nicely offering
   to help me by sending your nice 32x32 RBG PNG files to fix the art
   that I've found on the internet (thanks to lots of nice people
   referenced in file ART of the archive.)</p>

   <h2>Where is the documentation ???</h2>
   <p>The controls of the game are explained when typing 'rake help' or simply the 'h' key in the game.

   <p>I am preparing some documentation about how to create levels and
     write plugins.  After installation, you should have a
     '/usr/share/boots-puzzle/doc/boots-puzzle.html/index.html' file
     with the current state of it.</p>
