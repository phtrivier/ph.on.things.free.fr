   <h1>Yet another Pacman(tm?) remake</h1>

   <h2>What the hell is that ?</h2>
   <p>This is the game you all know. Not in a fancy version, for what
   it is... Just did it to play with the AI and to make a game I could
   actually play and lose.</p>

   <hr/>

   <h2>Hum...kay, what does it look like?</h2>
   <p>Guess what ? it's ugly. I riped graphics from here and there,
   the ghosts are a little too small, the text is not a the best
   place, etc..</p>

   <h2>Okay, let me try it !</h2>
   <p>Sure. You'll need to install ruby, rake, SDL and the ruby/SDL binding.</p>
   <p>They you grab the game <a href="releases/pacman.tar.gz">here</a>, you type
   <p class="command">
     rake play
   </p>
   and that should be it.
   </p>

   <h2>This doesn't work !!!!!</h2>
   <p>Okay, you can shout at phtrivier AT yahoo DOT fr, I might even be able to help. But I'm not planning on doing anything else on this.</p>

   <hr/>

   <h2>Where is the documentation ???</h2>
   <p>Wait you really need documentation on PACMAN ??? Jezz.</p>
